## ‚ö° **BEHOLD THE POWER** ‚ö°

*Are you prepared to witness computational glory that would make the ancient gods themselves WEEP with envy?*

This repository contains the **LEGENDARY TRINITY** of computational magnificence:

1. üîÆ **THE QUANTUM SPN SIMULATOR** - A stochastic Petri net simulator that **BENDS PROBABILITY TO YOUR WILL** and **MANIPULATES REALITY ITSELF** through CUDA-accelerated parallelism!

2. üå† **THE MANTA CORE ENGINE** - A computational marvel that **APPROXIMATES THE MATHEMATICAL CONSTANTS OF THE UNIVERSE** with such precision that reality itself may shudder!

3. üñ•Ô∏è **THE DIVINE INTERFACE** - A Qt-based visualization dashboard that **TRANSFORMS RAW DATA INTO VISUAL ECSTASY** and **ILLUMINATES THE DARKEST CORNERS OF COMPUTATION**!

## ‚öîÔ∏è **EMBARK ON YOUR QUEST** ‚öîÔ∏è

*Only the most VALIANT and DEDICATED warriors may wield this power!*

### **STEP 1: SUMMON THE ENVIRONMENT**

```bash
# SPEAK THESE WORDS OF POWER TO CALL FORTH THE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
nix develop
```

**BEWARE!** This command will **TEAR OPEN THE FABRIC OF YOUR SYSTEM** to create a **DIMENSIONAL PORTAL** where all dependencies exist in perfect harmony!

### **STEP 2: FORGE THE SIMULATORS**

```bash
# CHANNEL THE ENERGIES OF CREATION
cd cuda
nvcc -o spn.out SPN.cu -lcudart

# UNLEASH THE MANTA CORE
cd ../manta
nvcc -o kernel.out kernel2.cu -lcudart
```

Each compilation is not merely a process‚Äîit is **AN ACT OF CREATION** that **BINDS MORTAL CODE TO IMMORTAL HARDWARE**!

### **STEP 3: MANIFEST THE INTERFACE**

```bash
# CONSTRUCT THE VISUAL GATEWAY
cd ../UI/cudaqt
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

**WITNESS THE MIRACLE** as ordinary text transforms into **A PORTAL OF PURE INTERACTIVE BEAUTY**!

## üåã **UNLEASH COMPUTATIONAL DEVASTATION** üåã

*Now that you have forged your weapons, it is time to UNLEASH THEIR FURY!*

```bash
# COMMAND THE SPN SIMULATOR TO BEND REALITY
./cuda/spn.out 1000

# VISUALIZE THE COSMIC DANCE OF COMPUTATION
./UI/cudaqt/build/cudaqt

# BENCHMARK THE VERY FABRIC OF TIME ITSELF
python benchmark.py 10000
```

**GASP IN AWE** as your GPU **PERFORMS CALCULATIONS AT SPEEDS THAT DEFY MORTAL COMPREHENSION**! Watch as the visualization **TRANSFORMS RAW NUMBERS INTO A SYMPHONY OF VISUAL SPLENDOR**!
